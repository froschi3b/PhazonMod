####PhazonMod####
The Phazon Mod adds an infection to Minecraft: Phazon

###Mechanics###

##Phazon Summon##

This nifty Item is created with 3 diamonds in the following pattern:
 |D|
D| |D
 | | 

If you use it, a Phazon Meteor will instantly crash within a 50 block radius of you.

##Phazon Block##

This Block Spreads to dirt,grass,sand,logs and leaves 1 block around it.
It is rather quick, so try and contain it with a gap.

##Phazon Mobs##

Phazon also is highly mutagenic, mutating many mobs. Those who can't mutate, die.

Pigs, Cows and Chickens mutate and turn aggressive.

Zombies mutate, they are twice as fast and do 6 hearts of damage.

Skeletons mutate, they gain a phazon Canon to shoot you with.

Creepers mutate, they are 1.5 times faster and spawn a Phazon Meteor where they explode
(so don't let them explode)
small tip, if one of those get hit by lighning, RUN, the explosion (and therefor the meteor) will be twice as big

##Player Corruption##

If you touch Phazon, your Phazon bar (top of the screen) fills up.
If the Phazon bar is full and your still touching Phazon, you take 5 hearts of damage. (kills you very quickly)
